Project Reflection

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app I developed for this project was an event-tracking application. The requirements included a login screen that accepts credentials in the system, a registration page for users to join the system, an place to add or delete or update items, a method to request SMS permission to send users notifications when their event is coming up, and the ability to see a list of all events stored in a seperate database and able to be viewed as a grid. The goal was to create an app that fullfilled all of these requirements. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The login/registration screen and the events screen were both necessary to produce a user-centered app. My UI designs kept users in mind with the nice color scheme and an easy to understand UI that wasnt complicated. I feel my designs were successful because they accomplished the necessary tasks and stayed true to Android design principles. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

Initially I created a list of items I wanted to add to the application then I designed the look of the app. After that I started programming the layout with basic functionality followed by the implementation of the databases and SMS notifcation function. Creating a checklist of some sort with requirements and additional features before development will be a help with future projects. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested on different android devices using the built in emulater provided in Android Studio. This is important because you want you application to be as accessible as possible to reach more people on different devices. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I initially created the layout in Kotlin as I wanted to try it out. When I started implementing features I quickly realized I should use Java instead as I am more comfortable with it, so I had to convert what I could to Java and rewrite a few things in order to get my application to function how I wanted.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I feel that the development of my login/registration screen and database implementation were the most successful.
