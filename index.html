            <h3>Event Tracking Application</h3>
            <p>This event tracking app is a robust and user-friendly Android application designed to help users manage 
                their events, reminders, and tasks efficiently. Built with modern Android development practices, this app 
                allows users to create, update, and delete events, set reminders with alarms, and organize their schedules 
                seamlessly. The app features a clean and intuitive UI, secure user authentication, and real-time notifications, making it 
                a reliable tool for personal and professional use. This project demonstrates my skills in Java, XML, SQLite, and Android Studio.</p>

            <h3>PixelLock</h3>
            <p>This project is a Python application that enables users to encode passwords into images 
                using steganography techniques and decode them later. The application provides a graphical user 
                interface (GUI) for easy interaction, allowing users to upload images, enter passwords, and manage 
                secret keys for secure encoding and decoding. This project showcases my ability to work 
                with Python, Tkinter, and Pillow.</p>
