# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone
## Professional Self-Assessment
My experience in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been instrumental in refining my professional goals and strengthening my technical expertise. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I've developed the skills necessary to deliver immediate value to future employers.

This ePortfolio highlights my proficiency in designing and developing industry-standard software solutions. While it represents only a portion of my work in the program, it showcases my competencies in three key areas:

### Software Design & Engineering

### Algorithms & Data Structures

### Databases

Each project demonstrates my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world challenges.

Beyond technical skills, I gained experience communicating with stakeholders to ensure well-rounded products. My coursework included:

Software Development Lifecycle: Hands-on experience in cross-functional team roles (QA, product owner, project manager, developer)

Security Fundamentals: Multiple courses including Secure Coding and Client-Server Development, where I learned to assess vulnerabilities and implement security policies

## Capstone Project: Event Tracking Application
### Overview
A robust Android application that helps users manage events, reminders, and tasks efficiently. Features include:

- Intuitive UI built with ConstraintLayout, CardView, and RecyclerView

- Secure user authentication

- Real-time notifications using AlarmManager

- SQLite database with CRUD operations

## Enhancements
### Software Engineering & Design
- Implemented custom animations and themes for improved UX

- Refactored code into modular, reusable components

- Enhanced error handling and maintainability

- Isolated logic for better testability

### Algorithms & Data Structures
- Replaced linear search with hash maps for O(1) event access

- Implemented Comparator-based sorting for chronological display

- Added priority queue for efficient alarm scheduling

- Optimized RecyclerView performance

### Databases
- Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL for scalability

- Implemented asynchronous operations for UI responsiveness

- Added analytics tracking for event trends and user behavior

- Optimized queries and schema design
